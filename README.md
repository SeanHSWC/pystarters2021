# PyStarters 2021: Functions and hands-on practice with git/Github, Python functions and neural data analysis (May 13)

## Material

The main topics we will cover are:

1. hands-on practice with git/Github (clone, fork, commit, status, checkout, push, pull)
2. Python functions

and we will practice with:

- basic pandas
- basic matplotlib
- basic regression
- basic exceptions
- organizing code in modules
- neural data analysis

## Pre-session setup

Please before the session do the following:

1. install git following the instructions (here)[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git]

2. in a terminal type `conda activate pystarters` (change `pystarters` with the name that you used for the conda environment you created for the course).

3. in the terminal type `conda install statsmodels`

4. in the terminal type `cd <pystarters directory>/scripts` where `<pystarters directory>` is the directory you created for the course.

5. in the terminal type `python doFirstPlot.py Visual`. If your setup is correct, this command should create a plot in the file ../../figures/spikeRateVsabsSpeedV1Visual.png If this plot is not created please email Joaquin at j.rapela@ucl.ac.uk

## Session material

This session will only use a text editor to write code (no PyCharm needed) and a terminal to run it. We will cover:

1. Basic use of git and Github.

2. Python functions, positional and keyword arguments.

3. Use of functions to visualize electrophysiological recordings and linear regression to learn about these recordings.

We will experiment with the following packages:

- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` for visualizations
- `statsmodels` for linear regression

and with code organization in modules.
